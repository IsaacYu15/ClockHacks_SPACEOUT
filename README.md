Here is the [demo]   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Pc61B7gCo)
Here is the [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/spaced-out-fbv7tz)

# Note that:
This project was built in Unity. The final build can be played by downloading all the files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yRAy372DlA3zKufBeYxsesie-DlT4V7D?usp=sharing) and running clockhacks.exe (let me know if it doesn't work :D)

This repository contains all the assets (with the exception of TMPro) I created for ClockHacks 2022
All code can be found underneath the folder, Scripts

Enjoy!
