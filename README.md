# ClockHacks_SPACEOUT

I love flash cards. But I always find myself using them incorrectly, getting distracted on TikTok or Youtube while I'm taking a study break, and just seeing them as a boring chore. In this hackathon, I aimed to create a project that would tackle these 3 key issues.

Space Out Is a flashcard game designed to help you have fun and study effectively at the same time! Here is how it works:
1) **SPACE REPETITION:** Spaced Out! uses a spaced repetition system. As the user rates the difficulty of each flashcard, the program will show questions you struggle with more than the ones you don’t struggle with.
2) **SPACED LEARNING:** Whenever the user masters a card, they are rewarded with characters they can use to match and form new characters. This helps you take a 5-minute break when needed while providing further incentives to study.
3) **NO MORE SPACING OUT:** This app is designed to retain your focus. Music and animations follow a beat of roughly 60-90 bpm to induce your brain's “flow state”. Fun animations and graphics prevent users from becoming frustrated.
