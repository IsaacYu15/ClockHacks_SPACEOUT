# ClockHacks_SPACEOUT
SPACE OUT! is a mix and match game that involves a flash card system to help you study and have fun at the same time!

# Note that:
This project was built in Unity. The final build can be played by downloading from downloading all the files at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yRAy372DlA3zKufBeYxsesie-DlT4V7D?usp=sharing and running clockhacks.exe (let me know if it doesn't work :D)

This repository contains all the assets (with the exception of TMPro) I created for ClockHacks 2022
All code can be found underneath the folder, Scripts

Enjoy!
